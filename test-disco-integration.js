You: Hi, thanks for taking the time today. Before we dive in, can I ask? How is Dell currently leveraging AI across its operations or services?

Speaker 1: Well, we're really focused on AI-driven customer service and automation. We've implemented chatbots and virtual assistants across our support channels.

You: That's interesting. What specific challenges are you facing with your current AI implementation?

Speaker 1: The main issues are around scalability and accuracy. We're seeing about 70% accuracy in our current system, but we need to get to 90%+ to really trust it for customer interactions.

You: I understand. What would achieving that 90% accuracy mean for your business?

Speaker 1: It would mean we could handle 3x more customer inquiries without increasing headcount, and our customer satisfaction scores would improve significantly. We're looking at a potential $2M annual savings.

You: And what's your timeline for this improvement?

Speaker 1: We need to see results within the next 6 months. Our current system is becoming a bottleneck as we scale.
